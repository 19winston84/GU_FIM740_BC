This is the collection of exercises from the course Computational Biology (FIM770) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The course is a part of the Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) program.

Purpose: The aim of the course is to introduce students to the mathematical modeling of biological systems. The emphasis is on macroscopic phenomena such as population growth, morphogenesis and spreading of infectious diseases. Also microscopic phenomena are introduced, such as biochemical reactions, population genetics, and molecular evolution. A major topic is the role played by chance in the dynamics of biological systems, giving rise to stochastic fluctuations that must be described with statistical methods. The goal is to introduce mathematicians, physicists, and engineers to current important questions in Biology that require quantitative methods to solve.
